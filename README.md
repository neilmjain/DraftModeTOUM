# DraftModeTOUM

A [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) mod for **Among Us** running [Town of Us: Mira Edition (TOUM)](https://github.com/AU-Avengers/TOU-Mira) that adds a **Draft Mode** — players take turns picking their roles before the game begins instead of having them assigned randomly.

---

## Requirements

- Among Us (compatible version with TOUM)
- [BepInEx IL2CPP](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx)
- [Reactor](https://github.com/NuclearPowered/Reactor)
- [Town of Us: Mira Edition](https://github.com/AU-Avengers/TOU-Mira)

---

## Installation

1. Make sure BepInEx, Reactor, and TOUM are already installed and working.
2. Download the latest `DraftModeTOUM.dll` from [Releases](../../releases).
3. Drop it into your `BepInEx/plugins/` folder.
4. Launch Among Us — the mod will load automatically.

## How It Works

### Starting a Draft

Only the **host** can start a draft. Once everyone is in the lobby, the host types in chat:

```
/draft
```

This kicks off the draft sequence:

1. Each player is assigned a random **slot number** (their turn order).
2. The role pool is built from the host's current TOUM role settings.
3. Players pick one at a time in slot order.

---

### Taking Your Turn

When it's your turn, a role picker UI will appear. Choose one of the offered roles — or pick **Random** to be assigned any available role from the pool. Other players will see a waiting screen showing who is currently picking.

If the timer runs out before you pick, a random role is automatically assigned and the draft moves on.

---

## UI Styles

There are two different UIs for picking your role. Each player can choose their preferred style independently via Local Settings (see [Local Settings](#local-settings) below), or the host can set the default for everyone.

### Card Style

Roles are presented as large clickable cards spread across the screen. Each card shows the role name, faction, and icon with a colored glow.

### Circle Style

Roles are arranged in a spinning wheel around the center of the screen. Hovering over a role highlights it and shows its name and team in the center panel. A turn order list is displayed on the left side of the screen.

## Draft Settings

The host can configure Draft Mode from the **Mira settings menu** in the lobby. All options are synced to all players.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Enable Draft Mode | On | Enables or disables the `/draft` command entirely |
| Use Circle Style | Off | Sets the default UI style for all players (Off = Cards) |
| Lock Lobby On Draft Start | On | Prevents players from joining once the draft begins |
| Auto-Start After Draft | On | Automatically starts the game once all picks are made |
| Show Draft Recap | On | Shows a recap of everyone's roles after the draft ends |
| Use Role Chances For Weighting | On | Weighs role offers based on configured chances in TOUM settings |
| Show Random Option | On | Adds a "Random" option to each player's pick screen |
| Show Background Overlay | On | Shows a full-screen black background during the draft |
| Offered Roles Per Turn | 3 | How many roles each player is offered on their turn (1–9) |
| Turn Duration | 10s | How long each player has to make their pick (5–60s) |
| Max Impostors | 2 | Maximum number of Impostor roles that can be drafted |
| Max Neutral Killings | 2 | Maximum number of Neutral Killing roles that can be drafted |
| Max Neutral Other | 3 | Maximum number of passive/benign Neutral roles that can be drafted |

## Draft Recap

After every player has picked, a **Draft Recap** is shown on screen for all players, listing each pick slot and the role they chose. Role names are color-coded by their in-game color for easy readability.

![Draft Recap](screenshots/recap.png)

The recap can be toggled off so roles stay secret — only the player who picked knows what they got. To toggle it, the host can either use the **Show Draft Recap** option in settings, or type in chat:

```
/draftrecap
```

The current state is confirmed in chat:

```
Draft recap is now: OFF
```

---

## Chat Commands

| Command | Who | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/draft` | Host only | Starts the draft |
| `/draftrecap` | Host only | Toggles the draft recap on/off |
| `/draftend` | Host only | Cancels the currently active draft |

---

## Local Settings

Each player can override the host's UI style choice for themselves. Open **Settings → Mira → Draft Mode** to find:

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| Override UI Style | When ON, ignores the host's style setting and uses your own preference |
| Use Circle Style | The style to use when Override is ON. Off = Cards, On = Circle |

This means every player in the lobby can independently use whichever picker style they prefer, regardless of what the host has configured.

---

## Role Pool

The roles available to be drafted are controlled by the host's **TOUM Role Settings**. Only roles with a non-zero count and non-zero chance will appear in the pool. The following roles are permanently banned from the draft regardless of settings:

- Haunter
- Spectre
- Pestilence

Faction caps (Max Impostors, Max Neutral Killings, Max Neutral Other) are applied globally across the entire draft — once a cap is hit, no more roles of that faction will be offered to any player.
