# DraftModeTOUM

A [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) mod for **Among Us** running [Town of Us: Mira Edition (TOUM)](https://github.com/AU-Avengers/TOU-Mira) that adds a **Draft Mode** — players take turns picking their roles before the game begins instead of having them assigned randomly.

---

## Requirements

- Among Us (compatible version with TOUM)
- [BepInEx IL2CPP](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx)
- [Reactor](https://github.com/NuclearPowered/Reactor)
- [Town of Us: Mira Edition](https://github.com/AU-Avengers/TOU-Mira)

---

## Installation

1. Make sure BepInEx, Reactor, and TOUM are already installed and working.
2. Download the latest `DraftModeTOUM.dll` from [Releases](../../releases).
3. Drop it into your `BepInEx/plugins/` folder.
4. Launch Among Us — the mod will load automatically.

## How It Works

### Starting a Draft

Only the **host** can start a draft. Once everyone is in the lobby, the host types in chat:

```
/draft
```

This kicks off the draft sequence:

1. Each player is assigned a random **slot number** (their turn order).
2. The role pool is built from whichever roles are enabled in the TOUM lobby settings. If none are detected, all roles are available.
3. Players pick one at a time in slot order.

---

### Taking Your Turn

When it's your turn, you'll see a chat message like:

```
YOUR TURN!
1. Sheriff
2. Jester
3. Engineer
4. RANDOM
```

Type `1`, `2`, `3`, or `4` in chat to make your pick. Choosing `4` assigns you a fully random role from the remaining pool.

Other players will see:

```
Player 3 is picking...
```

---

### Turn Timer

Each player has **10 seconds** to pick. If the timer runs out, a random role is automatically assigned and the draft moves on. The host can change the timer duration in code via `DraftManager.TurnDuration` (default: `10f` seconds).

---

### Draft Recap

After every player has picked, a recap is shown in chat by default:

```
── DRAFT RECAP ──
Player 1: Sheriff
Player 2: Jester
Player 3: Engineer
```

To **hide the recap** (so roles stay secret), the host can type:

```
/draftrecap
```

This toggles the recap on or off. When off, players only see `── DRAFT COMPLETE ──` at the end with no roles listed. Toggle it again to turn it back on. The current state is confirmed in chat:

```
Draft recap is now: OFF
```

> The recap setting persists until toggled again or the game is restarted.

## Chat Commands

| Command | Who | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/draft` | Host only | Starts the draft |
| `/draftrecap` | Host only | Toggles the end-of-draft recap on/off |
| `1` / `2` / `3` | Active picker | Pick one of the 3 offered roles |
| `4` | Active picker | Pick a fully random role |

---

## Role Pool

The mod reads your TOUM lobby settings to build the role pool automatically — only roles with a count greater than 0 are included. If no roles are detected, the full list of TOUM roles is used as a fallback.

---

## Solo / Test Mode

If fewer than 2 players are in the lobby when `/draft` is typed, the mod enters **solo test mode** with 4 simulated slots so the host can test the flow without other players.
